## Instructions

### Task Overview

Create a tabbed product interface matching the provided design using TailwindCSS and Headless UI, with product data loaded through Remix's Loader function.

### Development Workflow

1. **Branch Creation:**
    *   Create a new branch from the latest codebase using your name with the following naming convention: `test/your-name`.
2. **Export Assets:**
    *   Export the required image assets from Figma to include in the project.
3. **Build the Product Card Component**
    *   Style using Tailwind
4. **Build Tab Interface:**
    *   Use the [**Headless UI Tabs**](https://headlessui.com/react/tabs) component to create the tab structure.

    *   Ensure the layout is responsive (3-column on desktop, 1-column on mobile)
5. **Load Product Data:**
    *   Implement Remix's Loader functionality to load the product data dynamically.
    *   Structure your product data as a JSON object and render it within each tab.
6. **Interactivity:**
    *   The "Add to Cart" button should be present for each product but does not need to be functional.
7. **Code Commit:**
    *   Commit your changes with descriptive messages as you work.
8. **Pushing Code:**
    *   Once development is complete, push your code to your brand
9. **Documentation:**
    *   Ensure to comment your code where necessary to explain complex logic or decisions.

### Note to Developer

*   Maintain a clean and modular code structure.
*   Test your work thoroughly before pushing to ensure functionality and design accuracy.
